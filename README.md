# LINT-PADS
 
The aim of this Pure Data program is to demonstrate the principles of the drama teaching technique - 'LINT PADS' (as described by Paul Elsam https://www.amazon.co.uk/Acting-Characters-Performance-Books-Elsam/dp/1408132842).  LINT PADS is divided between 'voice' (LINT) and 'speech' (PADS) ...

LINT = Loudness, Inflection, Note and Tone
PADS = Pace, Accent, Diction and Specials

"Loudness is the volume at which sound is created. This is affected most of all by two things: how much energy is used to expel the air used to vocalise sound; and how tense or relaxed the muscles are during speech."

"Inflection is the way in which the voice slides through different musical notes (think of the different appreciative "mmm" sounds you can make when tasting something really delicious). We tend to associate changes of inflection with speech: the selective use of higher or lower notes adds emphasis to particular words. It is common, however, to alter inflection when only using vocal sound, for example when laughing, crying, or experiencing sudden pain."

"Note describes the root note behind a person's voice; this is the musical note around which a person's inflection fluctuates. It is especially noticeable when you yawn. Typically, males have a lower root note than females."

"Tone is the hardness or softness of the quality of sound you make. It's not easy to alter tone - it's tied in strongly to accent, and to cultural factors (such as pressure from peers to sound tough). To alter tone consciously you need to be able to relax or tense muscles at will - especially in the throat."

"Pace is simply how quickly the words are spoken. Urban accents tend to feature faster speech than country accents but psychological factors such as confidence also have a strong influence on pace."

"Accent is the distinctive regional or social sound heard when a person speaks. It's generally agreed nowadays that Standard English is also an accent; it's helpful to remember this when exploring accents, as students sometimes perceive Standard English to be accentless, and thus somehow superior to a strong regional accent."

"Diction describes how well articulated the words are during speech. This is mostly affected by muscularity during speech: the lips (which are
of course muscles) play a central role here."

"Specials are variations in sound pronunciation Ã± what used to be called speech defects. Examples include an over-sibilant "s" sound, using "w" instead of "r" (think Jonathan Ross), using "f" instead of "th" ("Fink about it")."
